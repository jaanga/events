## Concept
A 3D talk about 3D 

## Highlights

Jaanga unFlatland r10 and FGx Plane Spotter r3. Real-time big data 3D cartography. Fully FOSSelized.

* 'Slippy Map' Tile Map System (TMS) - hierarchical binning - is a nifty 3D asset manager
* Heightmaps are an effective way to store 3D elevation data. And the easiest to implement
* Jonathan de Ferranti's 3D elevation data is many ways amazing
* OSGEO's GDAL beats out Imagemagick for batch processing bitmaps
* Canvas element's context multiplies the matrices for you - fast
* GitHub is your friend. Though of CORS not.
* 3D cartography is now fast, cheap and easy

It's not about building a mapping app  
It's about extending our languages
