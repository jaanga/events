## Concept

### Code for dummies  

- for pilots, architects, not programmers
- no jQuery or node


<div style=display:none >
Newton said 'I am standing on the shoulder's of giants'

He was very smart. You should we should - all follow in his footsteps.

Just make sure your feet are clean so you don't dirty the shoulders.

This talk is about helping you find good sholders to stand on

The first set is the shoulder's of Mr.doob. His shoulders will be mentioned more than once.

	The aim of the project is to create a lightweight 3D library with a very low level of complexity â€” in other words, for dummies. 

The essence is that a dummy is someone who is not a pogrammer.

Maybe you are a pilot, or contractor or mechanical engineer. A person with excellent skills in their domain, but limited abilities to program.

I see this time and time again. Look at the ource code then look at the examples. The source code written for programmers. The examples for end users

Both in JavaScript. Both parallel in objectives. But two very different styles of writing. 
- The code is objectified, closured, gulped, hatever
- The examples old school function calls. =, if, for/to are the only things you need to know

In my code their is not even any HTML or CSS. Both are handled via JavaScript and the Document Object Model( DOM )


</div>


### Free both ways

- no hosting costs

### Stand on shoulders of giants
- fast and tiny

## This is a start

Compare with September versions

## TMS is your fiend

No database needed. Rest-enabled  
Look who is using it: both Google and OSM  
Tons of help  
Covers huge areas  

Math is easy - wiki link
Tools are there  
Works equally well as flatland or 3D Globe
Use it for games, for tracking assets  

## de Ferranti s your friend
Where's the data?  
2000 Shuttle mission  
mishmash of out of data stuff and broken links  
Kind of weird: we know the lat lon of just about everywhere on earth, but not it's elevation.  
We are true flatlanders  
Savior Jonathan de Ferranti  
Probably a character  

## GDAL/OSGEO is your friend  
Look at PNG viewer
Currently source of many errors
At the start of the learning curve ~ 2nd pass may fix many issues


## Heightmaps are your friends

* tonyparisi land heightmap demo


## GitHub is your friend

Seven - with 16,000 files - is the magic level  
Three gigs of data means three repos  
Forking is easy - no need to download - just a file or two for testing
Planning on making CORS files available on Bluehost server - if anybody wants just holler
 

## Canvas is your friend

getImageData and putImageData are amazing

## Very Rev 0.5

Second pass theough de Ferranti/ GDAL should fix much

## Apps  
Crossfeed  
geoJSON  
Sky writing  



## Future: Buffer Geometry

What you see is just the start  

## Call to Action

* Where are the 3D client-sie coding buddies?
* Everybody out there is server-based or a 2D flatlander
* Should there be a Google Groups
